## Introduction<br>
With the high development of telecom technology, people are able to access the high-speed internet network. Cell phone becomes an indispensable part of our daily life since we use it to access a network. 4G LTE is the most common standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile devices and data terminals. However, Sometimes we may find that the network speed differs a lot in different condition. Even though every person using smartphones may have some intuitive knowledge that how fast your smartphone downloads data often depends on where you are, when you use it, even how you are using it, we want to figure out the potential factors which may affect the 4G LTE network speed.<br> 
In this experiment, instead of instinct, fractional factorial design was used to figure out which factors matter and which ones donâ€™t, as well as help finding optimal settings for highest download speeds. The Pareto principle had been applied to the analysis process for helping screen out a few important factors before we got the regression equation.
